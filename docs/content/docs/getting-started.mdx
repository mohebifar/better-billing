Better Billing is a plugin-based billing system that provides type-safe subscription and payment management. This guide will walk you through the basic setup with the core plugin, which provides essential billing functionality without any payment processor.

## Installation

Install the required packages:


```bash tab="npm"
npm install better-billing
```

```bash tab="pnpm"
pnpm add better-billing
```

```bash tab="yarn"
yarn add better-billing
```

```bash tab="bun"
bun add better-billing
```

## Core Setup

Here's a basic setup with the core plugin only:

```typescript
import drizzleAdapter from "@better-billing/db/adapters/drizzle";
import { betterBilling } from "better-billing";
import { corePlugin } from "better-billing/plugins/core";
import { drizzle } from "drizzle-orm/postgres-js";
import postgres from "postgres";

import * as schema from "./schema";

// Initialize your database (example with Drizzle and PostgreSQL)
const connectionString = process.env.DATABASE_URL!;
const client = postgres(connectionString);
const drizzleDb = drizzle(client);

// Create Better Billing instance
const billing = betterBilling({
  serverUrl: "http://localhost:3000",
  adapter: drizzleAdapter(drizzleDb, {
    provider: "pg",
    schema, // Your Drizzle schema
  }),
  plugins: [
    corePlugin({
      subscriptionPlans: [
        {
          planName: "Free",
        },
        {
          planName: "Pro",
          trialDays: 7,
        },
        {
          planName: "Enterprise",
          trialDays: 14,
        },
      ],
    }),
  ] as const,
});
```

## Understanding the Setup

### 1. Database Adapter

The `drizzleAdapter` connects Better Billing to your database:

```typescript
drizzleAdapter(drizzleDb, {
  provider: "pg",        // Database provider: "pg" | "mysql" | "sqlite"
  schema,                // Drizzle schema
})
```

### 2. Core Plugin

The core plugin provides essential billing functionality and schema:

```typescript
corePlugin({
  subscriptionPlans: [
    { planName: "Free" },
    { planName: "Pro", trialDays: 7 },
    { planName: "Enterprise", trialDays: 14 },
  ],
})
```

**Required:** The core plugin is mandatory as it provides the foundational database schema and billing concepts including:
- Billable entities (users, organizations, teams)
- Subscription management
- Plan definitions
- Payment methods storage
- Invoice tracking

## Set up API Endpoints

For future webhooks and API functionality, you'll want to set up API endpoints in your framework:

### Next.js

Create a catch-all API route:

```typescript
// app/api/billing/[...path]/route.ts
import { billing } from "@/lib/billing";
import { toNextJsHandler } from "better-billing/integrations/next-js";

const handler = toNextJsHandler(billing.api);

export const { GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH } = handler;
```

### Other Frameworks

Better Billing supports React Start, Solid Start, SvelteKit, Node.js/Express, and more. Each framework has a dedicated adapter for easy integration.

See the [Framework Integrations guide](/docs/integrations) for detailed setup instructions for all supported frameworks.

## Using the Core Functionality

With the core setup, you can manage billable entities and subscriptions:

### Check Active Subscriptions

```typescript
const activeSubscriptions = await billing.providers.core.getBillableActiveSubscriptions({
  billableId: "user_123",
  billableType: "user",
});

// Check if user has a specific plan
const hasProPlan = activeSubscriptions.some((s) => s.planName === "Pro");

// Check for any premium features
const hasPremiumAccess = activeSubscriptions.some(s => 
  ["Pro", "Enterprise"].includes(s.planName)
);
```

### Working with Plans

The core plugin provides plan management without payment processing:

```typescript
// Plans are defined in your plugin configuration
const availablePlans = ["Free", "Pro", "Enterprise"];

// You can use plans for feature gating
function hasFeatureAccess(planName: string, feature: string): boolean {
  const featureMap = {
    "Free": ["basic_usage"],
    "Pro": ["basic_usage", "advanced_features"],
    "Enterprise": ["basic_usage", "advanced_features", "priority_support"]
  };
  
  return featureMap[planName]?.includes(feature) ?? false;
}
```
